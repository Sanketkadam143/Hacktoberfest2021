Binary lifting algorithm for n-ary tree. 
It is useful for queries like finding a node located at height h from a given node in O(log N) time whereas naive approch will do in O(N) time. N - number of nodes. 
It can be used to get LCA queries too. 
DISCLAIMER : DON'T USE NODE WITH NUMBER 0. START FROM 1.
